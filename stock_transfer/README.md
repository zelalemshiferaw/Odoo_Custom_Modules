Stock Transfer
---------------------------
The Stock Transfer module allows for requesting and tracking internal stock transfers between locations. It provides a fully automated workflow for approval and fulfillment of transfer requests.

Request Initiation and Approval
--------------------------------
Users can create transfer requests from their assigned location. Requests go through a configurable approval workflow before confirmation. Approvers are notified by email.

Item Details with Stock Tracking
--------------------------------
Transfer items include product, quantities, and available stock levels. Stock levels auto-update on location change. Item demands cannot exceed available quantities.

Automatic Picking Generation
--------------------------------
On approval, a picking is created automatically containing transfer items. Stock moves link to request lines for tracking.

Customizable Workflow States
--------------------------------
Requests support draft, waiting, approved, received and canceled states. Actions trigger state changes and assign responsible users.

Integrated Inventory Management
--------------------------------
Only allow requests from locations with sufficient stock levels. Inventory moves tracked via associated pickings. Maintain accurate stock balances.

User Assignment and Validation

Users assigned source locations for initiation. Destination users receive and complete transfers. Validations prevent invalid actions by users.
